## About

### ðŸŸ¨ What is Concrete
Concrete is an open-source FHE Compiler which simplifies the use of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE).

FHE is a powerful cryptographic tool, which allows computation to be performed directly on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. With FHE, you can build services that preserve privacy for all users. FHE is also great against data breaches as everything is done on encrypted data. Even if the server is compromised, in the end no sensitive data is leaked.

Since writing FHE programs can be difficult, Concrete, based on LLVM, make this process easier for developers. Concrete is a generic library that supports a variety of use cases. If you have a specific use case, or a specific field of computation, you may want to build abstractions on top of Concrete. One such example is [Concrete ML](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml), which is built on top of Concrete to simplify Machine Learning oriented use cases.
<br></br>

### ðŸŸ¨ Main features
Concrete features include:
- Ability to compile Python functions (that may include NumPy) to their FHE equivalents, to operate on encrypted data
- Support for [large collection of operators](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete/getting-started/compatibility)
- Partial support for floating points
- Support for table lookups on integers
- Support for integration with Client / Server architectures

*Learn more features in Concrete's [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete/readme).*

## Getting Started

###  ðŸŸ¨ Installation
Depending on your OS, Concrete ML may be installed with Docker or with pip:

|               OS / HW                       | Available on Docker | Available on PyPI |
| :-----------------------------------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------: |
|                Linux                        |         Yes         |       Yes        |
|               Windows                       |         Yes         |    Coming soon   |
|     Windows Subsystem for Linux             |         Yes         |       Yes        |
|            macOS 11+ (Intel)                |         Yes         |       Yes        |
| macOS 11+ (Apple Silicon: M1, M2, etc.)     |         Yes         |       Yes        |


#### Docker
The preferred way to install Concrete is through PyPI:

```shell
pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
pip install concrete-python
```

#### Pip
You can get the concrete-python docker image by pulling the latest docker image:

```shell
docker pull zamafhe/concrete-python:v2.0.0
```

*Find more detailed installation instructions in [this part of the documentation](docs/getting-started/installing.md)*

### ðŸŸ¨ A simple example
To compute on encrypted data, you first need to define the function you want to compute, then compile it into a Concrete Circuit, which you can use to perform homomorphic evaluation.
Here is the full example that we will walk through:

```python
from concrete import fhe

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

compiler = fhe.Compiler(add, {"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
inputset = [(2, 3), (0, 0), (1, 6), (7, 7), (7, 1), (3, 2), (6, 1), (1, 7), (4, 5), (5, 4)]

print(f"Compiling...")
circuit = compiler.compile(inputset)

print(f"Generating keys...")
circuit.keygen()

examples = [(3, 4), (1, 2), (7, 7), (0, 0)]
for example in examples:
    encrypted_example = circuit.encrypt(*example)
    encrypted_result = circuit.run(encrypted_example)
    result = circuit.decrypt(encrypted_result)
    print(f"Evaluation of {' + '.join(map(str, example))} homomorphically = {result}")
```

Or if you have a simple function that you can decorate, and you don't care about explicit steps of key generation, encryption, evaluation and decryption:

```python
from concrete import fhe

@fhe.compiler({"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

inputset = [(2, 3), (0, 0), (1, 6), (7, 7), (7, 1), (3, 2), (6, 1), (1, 7), (4, 5), (5, 4)]

print(f"Compiling...")
circuit = add.compile(inputset)

examples = [(3, 4), (1, 2), (7, 7), (0, 0)]
for example in examples:
    result = circuit.encrypt_run_decrypt(*example)
    print(f"Evaluation of {' + '.join(map(str, example))} homomorphically = {result}")
```
*This example is explained in more detail in the [Quick Start](docs/getting-started/quick_start).*
